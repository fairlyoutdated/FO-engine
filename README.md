# FO-engine
Game engine that supports games up to 4D.

## Technicalities
FairlyOutdated's engine uses raylib for rendering. It uses a fucking dumb idiotic build utility for auto-adding C++ files to the build script. Util's code available in ./buildtool/main.cpp.

The engine is based on my older engine called "Neat". I decided to fork it completely because I already knew it was functional, but a bit rusty. 

## How to use
Even though I don't recommend using the engine in its current state, it is possible to use it.
1 - Download this repo
2 - Copy the "foneat" folder in the folder where you plan to put your game's code
3 - Build to make sure it's adequate
4 - You can start working on the game!
