# FO-engine
Game engine that supports games up to 4D.

## Technicalities
FairlyOutdated's engine uses raylib for rendering. It uses a fucking dumb idiotic build utility for auto-adding C++ files to the build script. Util's code available in ./buildtool/main.cpp.

Does the engine do anything? Not yet.
